# Expenses-Tracker
A single-page application for tracking and saving expenses. An animated visual chart shows, in real-time, how much was spent monthly.
Users can create an account, add and delete expenses. The application was built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js,
React.js, and Node.js. All the application's front-end components were made from scratch.
